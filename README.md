# Rebuild recipes for Software Collections

The idea behind this repo is to prepare a recipe for every collection that will include *steps to build the collection from scratch*. This will also help everybody else (users/customers) trying to do the same, so it may be part of the documentation later as well.

The basic information we want to track for rebuilding collections is:
* `packages` -- set of SRPM belonging to particular collection
* `requires` -- list of collections it depends on
* `name` -- nice name of the collcetion, just for completeness
* macros we need to change in order to break circular dependencies as list of `macro_name value`
* in the best case also order in which the packages get rebuilt

In order to be able to parse the recipe and hopefully rebuild the collections *automatically*, let's use the same format.

The recipes could be also available at https://www.softwarecollections.org/en/docs/ in the future as well.

The format is YAML and it is basically a list of packages in the order in which they may be built and for every package we can specify tweaks necessary to be done. It seems handy to be able to specify recipes for more similar collections in one file, so let's allow it.

An incomplete (in a way not all packages are mentioned here) example of python collection recipe:
